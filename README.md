Google Family Link Home Assistant Integration
![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-41BDF5.svg)
This project is a custom Home Assistant integration (compatible with HACS) to control Google Family Link features, such as locking and unlocking children's devices, through Home Assistant automations. Since Google Family Link lacks a public API, this integration uses browser automation with Playwright to handle authentication (including 2FA) and scrape the web interface to identify control endpoints. Session cookies are captured and used with HTTP requests for ongoing interactions, avoiding the need to store sensitive credentials.
Project Goal
The goal is to create a robust Home Assistant integration that allows users to:
Authenticate with Google Family Link by interacting with the official login pages in a browser, supporting 2FA and other security prompts.

Control Family Link features (e.g., locking/unlocking devices) via Home Assistant switch entities.

Automate tasks like locking children's devices at specific times (e.g., bedtime).

Provide a user-friendly setup process through Home Assistant’s configuration flow.

Ensure reliability and security by managing session cookies and handling expiration.

This integration aims to be submitted to the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) for easy installation by users.
Features
Browser-Based Authentication: Uses Playwright to present Google’s login pages, allowing users to complete authentication (including 2FA) without storing usernames or passwords in Home Assistant.

Session Cookie Management: Captures and reuses session cookies for secure, ongoing interactions with Family Link’s web interface.

Device Control: Exposes Family Link devices as Home Assistant switch entities for locking/unlocking.

Automation Support: Enables Home Assistant automations to control devices based on schedules, events, or other triggers.

Cookie Refresh: Automatically refreshes session cookies when they expire, prompting users to re-authenticate via the browser if needed.

HACS Compatibility: Designed as a custom component for easy installation via HACS.

Why This Approach?
Google Family Link does not provide a public API, making direct integration challenging. Previous attempts, such as the familylink Python package (https://github.com/tducret/familylink), likely rely on reverse-engineering or scraping, which can be brittle. This project takes a fresh approach by:
Using Playwright for reliable browser automation to handle complex login flows (e.g., 2FA, CAPTCHAs).

Scraping the Family Link web interface (https://families.google.com) to identify endpoints for device control.

Avoiding credential storage by relying on session cookies.

Building a maintainable, HACS-compatible integration for the Home Assistant community.

Development Plan
1. Authentication with Playwright
Use Playwright to launch a non-headless Chromium browser, navigate to https://families.google.com, and allow the user to complete the Google login process (including 2FA prompts like SMS, authenticator codes, or push notifications).

Capture session cookies (e.g., SID, HSID, SSID) after successful login and save them to a JSON file (e.g., /config/familylink_cookies.json).

Implement a mechanism to detect cookie expiration and prompt users to re-authenticate via the browser.

2. Scraping Family Link Web Interface
Use Playwright to explore the Family Link web interface and identify:
Device lists and their unique IDs.

Actions for locking/unlocking devices (e.g., button clicks or form submissions).

Network requests (e.g., POST/GET endpoints) triggered by these actions.

Reverse-engineer the necessary HTTP requests to replicate device control actions using the requests library with saved cookies.

Document endpoints and parameters for locking/unlocking devices (e.g., https://families.google.com/api/lock?device_id=12345).

3. HTTP Requests for Device Control
Develop a Python client that uses the requests library with session cookies to interact with Family Link endpoints.

Implement methods for listing devices, locking, and unlocking devices based on scraped endpoints.

Ensure requests include appropriate headers, cookies, and payloads to mimic browser behavior and avoid bot detection.

4. Home Assistant Integration
Create a custom component in the custom_components/familylink/ directory, following Home Assistant’s guidelines.

Implement a configuration flow to:
Prompt users for a cookie storage path (e.g., /config/familylink_cookies.json).

Trigger Playwright to open a browser for authentication during setup.

Expose Family Link devices as switch entities (switch.family_link_device_name) for locking (off) and unlocking (on).

Support Home Assistant automations, e.g., locking devices at 9 PM.

5. Cookie Management and Refresh
Load cookies from the JSON file for each request.

Check cookie validity (e.g., by testing a device list request) before actions.

If cookies are invalid, prompt the user to re-authenticate via Playwright.

Optionally, implement periodic cookie refresh (e.g., every 24 hours) to maintain seamless operation.

Development Requirements
Python Libraries:
playwright: For browser automation and cookie capture.

requests: For HTTP requests to Family Link endpoints.

Dependencies:
Install Playwright binaries (playwright install) in the development and Home Assistant environments.

Ensure compatibility with Home Assistant’s Docker or virtual environment.

Tools:
Browser DevTools (e.g., Chrome) to inspect Family Link’s web interface and network requests.

Optional: stealth.min.js (from https://github.com/berstend/puppeteer-extra) for Playwright to reduce bot detection.

Environment:
Python 3.8+ (compatible with Home Assistant).

Home Assistant instance for testing (local or Docker).

Test Google account for development (avoid using personal accounts due to terms of service risks).

Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/familylink-hacs.git

Install Dependencies:
bash

pip install playwright requests
playwright install

Place in Home Assistant:
Copy the familylink folder to custom_components/ in your Home Assistant configuration directory.

Configure in Home Assistant:
Add the integration via the Home Assistant UI (Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration).

Follow the configuration flow to specify a cookie storage path and complete browser-based authentication.

Test:
Verify that switch entities appear for Family Link devices.

Test locking/unlocking devices via the Home Assistant UI or automations.

Challenges and Considerations
No Official API: Family Link lacks a public API, so the integration relies on scraping and reverse-engineering, which may break if Google updates the web interface.

Bot Detection: Google may flag automated browser sessions as bots, triggering CAPTCHAs or login restrictions. Use Playwright’s stealth features (e.g., stealth.min.js) to mimic real browsers.

2FA: Users must manually complete 2FA during authentication. Ensure clear instructions for handling SMS, authenticator, or push notifications.

Cookie Expiration: Session cookies expire (e.g., days or weeks). Implement robust refresh logic to prompt users for re-authentication when needed.

Google’s Terms of Service: Scraping and automating Family Link may violate Google’s terms, risking account suspension. Developers and users should use test accounts and be informed of risks.

Home Assistant Environment: Ensure Playwright binaries and dependencies are compatible with Home Assistant’s Docker or virtual environment. Consider a custom add-on for Playwright if needed.

Device Identification: The integration must reliably identify devices (e.g., via unique IDs) to support per-device control.

Alternative Approaches
If scraping proves unreliable, consider:
Manual Cookie Import: Allow users to export cookies from a browser (e.g., using EditThisCookie) and import them into Home Assistant. This avoids automated login but requires manual updates.

Android Debug Bridge (ADB): Use Home Assistant’s ADB integration to lock Android devices directly (e.g., adb shell input keyevent 26). Requires USB debugging on devices.

Tasker Integration: Use Tasker on children’s Android devices to lock screens via HTTP/MQTT triggers from Home Assistant. Requires setup on each device.
